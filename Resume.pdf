### Summary
I graduated in Computer Science from Binghamton University, NY, and have been working as a Software Engineer for the last 8 years in different domains like robotic operating systems, communications, health, and e-commerce. My passion for learning, solving, and automating problems/processes always keeps me focused and excited about what I do as a developer. One of my core beliefs is "it’s never too late to start something new."
